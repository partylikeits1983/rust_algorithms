You are given an integer, N. Write a program to determine if N is an element of the Fibonacci sequence.

The first few elements of the Fibonacci sequence are
0,1,1,2,3,5,8,13,... . A Fibonacci sequence is one where every element is a sum of the previous two elements in the sequence. The first two elements are 0 and 1
